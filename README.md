# Project Grapevine

### While we don't have front-end handlers for creating servers or users, you MUST use either postman or httpie to PUT servers / users in the database. Server name MUST be "test1" for now.
### SERVER "test1" MUST ALSO BE THE SERVER WITH ID 1. IT HAS TO BE THE FIRST SERVER CREATED. SERVER ID IS HARDCODED.
